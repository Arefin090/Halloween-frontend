      <List>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Supervision Required: Ensure that your little monsters are accompanied by an adult or responsible older sibling or guardian. Safety first!</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Costume Check: Please ensure costumes are safe. Avoid overly long capes or anything that could cause tripping. Masks should not impair vision. Most importantly, costumes should be comfortable.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Allergy Alerts: If your child has food allergies, please inform us ahead of time or check with each house to avoid any mishaps. Some houses may offer non-food treats! Kindly check if the treats are suitable for your kids.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Route Planning: Plan your route and set a time limit for trick-or-treating. Stick to well-lit areas and always cross streets at crosswalks.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Respect the Rules: Follow any specific guidelines provided by the community or individual houses. If a house displays a "No Trick-or-Treating" sign, please respect it.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Accidents: We are not responsible for any accident or damage that may occur during the event.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Emergency Contact: Make sure your child has a contact number written down in case they get separated. Also, have a way to reach you or another responsible adult.</ListItem>

      <SectionTitle>ðŸ‘‰ For Kids:</SectionTitle>
      <List>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Be Polite: Remember to say "Trick-or-Treat!" when you arrive at each door, and donâ€™t forget to say "Thank you!" when you get your goodies.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Stay Safe: Stick to sidewalks and avoid running. Watch out for cars and always look both ways before crossing the street.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Buddy System: Stay in groups with friends or family. Itâ€™s more fun and safer!</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Inspect Your Treats: Before munching on any goodies, have your parents check them to make sure theyâ€™re safe and sealed.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Respect Property: Donâ€™t damage decorations or property. Be respectful to homeowners and their Halloween displays.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Be Thoughtful: Just take a couple of lollies per house so other kids can still have some.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» CLAY-GO: Clean as you go! Take the wrapping of the lollies with you to avoid littering.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>ðŸ‘» Have Fun: The most important thing is to enjoy the night, the treats, and all the spooky fun!</ListItem>
